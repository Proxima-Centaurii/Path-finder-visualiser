# A-star-visualiser
A visualising tool for A* shortest path algorithm.
The "MAX_BLEVEL" variable represents the maximum amount of blocks the algorithm may remove in order to find the shortest path. Can only be changed in code.

CONTROLS:
-	Right click -> place block (first start, then destination followed by walls)
-	Left click -> remove block
-	SPACE -> run the algorithm
-	C -> clear whole grid
-	R -> reset the current run (keeps block placements)

NOTE: Requires the PyGame library and Python 3 to run.
