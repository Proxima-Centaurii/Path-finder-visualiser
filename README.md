# Path-finder visualiser
A visualising tool for informed and uninformed space search algorithms (Greedy, A*, Depth First Search, Breadth First Search).
Allows the user to create their own mazes.

CONTROLS:
-	Right click -> place block (first start, then destination followed by walls)
-	Left click -> remove block
-	SPACE -> run the algorithm
-	C -> clear whole grid
-	R -> reset the current run (keeps block placements)
-	H -> to print the help menu
-	S -> cycle through the available algorithms (Greedy, A* , DFS, BFS)

NOTE: Requires Python 3.9 with and the PyGame library to run.
